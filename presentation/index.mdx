# Get Hooked on React Hooks

## An introduction to the new Hooks API

---

# Hooks are a new way to handle state and side effects in React

Hooks provide an alternative API to React.Component classes (and by extension HOCs and render props)

Rather than providing class methods for state management and side effects, Hooks are exported directly from the React core and can be used in function components.

---

# Don't worry about Hooks!

The only way to use Hooks right now is to use the alpha release of React.

Note that **Hooks will not replace class components**. The addition of Hooks is backwards compatible.

Your class components will continue to have first-class support in React.

---

# Why Hooks?

## Encapuslation of logic

Class state and lifecycle force related logic to be spread out across methods.  

---

## Typical class-based workflow:

- Initialize state in the constructor
- Access state in render method to display data
- Perform side effect in `componentDidMount`
- Re-fetch data and update state in callback
- Perform side effect in `componentDidUpdate`

---

## Typical class-based workflow continued:

- Update state from props in `getDerivedStateFromProps`
- Cancel side-effect in `componentWillUnmount`

---

# This is a bit of a mess

State management and side effects are strewn about this class and hard to follow.  

---

# Hooks workflow

- Initialize (and re-initialize if necessary) state and get value and setter for the value with single `useState`
- Perform side effect when necessary, and cancel when component is gone, with `useEffect`

# Basic Usage

---
export default CodeSlide

```javascript
// class component
// import React, { Component } from "react"

class Thing extends Component {

  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      thing: props.thing,
    };
  }

  render() {
    const { thing } = this.state;
    return ...
  }

}
```

---

export default CodeSlide

```javascript
// Hooks component
// import React, { useState } from "react";

const Thing = props => {
  const [thing, setThing] = useState(props.thing);
  return ...
}
```
